Big letters on every packet of cigarettes warn against smoking. Still hundreds of thousands are sold every day. Even eleven-year-old children take to smoking - the habit the results of which are fairly easy to predict. The number of serious illnesses such as lung cancer or heart disease are the reward for the most devoted smokers.

Let us look at the reasons why young people start smoking. First they smoke because their friends do. They do not want to be different from the rest of the group. Sometimes they do not have the courage to refuse when offered a cigarette. Another reason is that they want to feel adult. If you smoke, you are a grown-up. That is what they think. At the same time, by smoking cigarettes they rebel against the world of grown-ups. They do not agree to be told not to smoke. They want to be independent. Young people also imagine that clouds of smoke will make them look attractive, and in fact it is just the opposite.

Whatever the reasons, hardly anyone pays attention to the fact that it is simply harmful to smoke.
