In the Tatras you can visit the National Park with impressive mountainous landscapes, beautiful valleys formed by glaciers, and come across such animals as the chamois, the eagle or the marmot You can climb Kasprowy Wierch or Giewont, or take the cable railway to Gubalowka. The Tatra Mountains have much to offer as far as culture and architecture are concerned. You can visit the Museum of the Tatra Mountains and the ones devoted to Jan Kasprowicz or Witkacy. Another thing worth seeing while in the Tatra Mountains is the monument of Sabala and Tytus Chalubinski - the 'discoverers' of Zakopane. A walk along Krupowki and the taste of oscypek - the Zakopanian specialty, will make the memories of your visit to the Tatras last longer.

As you can see there are a lot of interesting places in Poland and it is hard to enumerate all of them but there is also one area I would like to recommend to all foreigners visiting Poland, I mean Mazury - Polish Lake District. This region of woods and lakes is ecologically the cleanest in Poland. It has got a well developed tourist infrastructure. There are many tourist attractions there. You can visit a gothic church in Lidzbark Warminski, or make a journey through the trail of Mazury Lakes and Augustowski Canal.

In conclusion I would like to say that Poland is a country of great diversity. There is something for everybody and those tourists who choose it as a place for their holidays will certainly not be disappointed.
